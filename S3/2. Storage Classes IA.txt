Objective:
Explore different storage classes
Store object in Infrequent Access Storage Class 
Observe access behavior
Optimize cost of storage by using a tiering strategy

Steps:
1. From Services, open "S3" management console
2. It shows available buckets in the account
3. Open your bucket lab-<UserName>  (Example: lab-chandra)

4. Add Files 
    Select the file: AWSWhitePapers\AWS-Cost-Optimization-Pillar.pdf    
    
5. Go to "Next"

6. What you see is the permissions at the object level (Object Access Control List)
	Select "Next"

7. You can now pick the storage class for your object
	Standard = Hot Data. Frequently accessed data with multi-az availability and durability
	Standard-IA = Warm Data. Infrequently accessed data with multi-az availability and durability
				  Same performance as standard
	
	Intelligent-Tiering = New Option. 
	Automatically moves objects between standard and infrequent access 
	based on access pattern. Additional monitoring and tiering fees apply
	One-Zone IA = Warm Data. Infrequently accessed data with single-az availability and durability
				  Same performance as standard
	Glacier = Cold Data with high durability
8. Select "Standard-IA" and upload the object
9. Object is now stored in Standard-IA Storage Class
9. You can access the object any time you need. Storage cost is 50% cheaper when compared to Standard. However, there is an additional per GB access fee everytime you access the object [hence the name infrequent access]
